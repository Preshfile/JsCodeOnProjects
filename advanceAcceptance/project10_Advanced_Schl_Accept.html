    Title: Advanced School Acceptance System Case Study
        Objective:
        The objective of this case study is to create 
        an advanced JavaScript program for a School Acceptance System. 
        
        The system will take a student's accumulated score, grade, 
        and their choice of program as input and determine 
        whether the student is accepted into the chosen program 
        based on the following criteria:

        Accumulated Score Requirement: Minimum of 800.
        For Science program: Requires a minimum grade of 85.
        For Arts program: Requires a minimum grade of 75.
        For Commerce program: Requires a minimum grade of 80.
        Requirements:
        Create an HTML file with a form that takes the student's accumulated score, grade, and choice of program as input.
        Write JavaScript code to process the user's input and display whether the student is accepted into the chosen program based on the new criteria.
        Implement error handling and user-friendly messages for invalid inputs or unexpected scenarios (e.g., negative score or grade, non-numeric inputs, or an invalid choice of program).
        Display the result on the webpage indicating whether the student is accepted into the chosen program or not.
